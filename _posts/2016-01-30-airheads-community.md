description: 'This is the third blog post in a series about WLAN capacity planning. Be sure to read the first and second posts. In my previous post, I outlined the major factors affecting network performance, including geographic delay (latency), serialization delay (commonly referred to as bandwidth or speed), and variable contention delay (another form of latency, often forgotten).'
